### Hi there, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania's [Management and Technology (M&T)](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu) Program! I'm pursuing a B.S.E in Computer Science form the School of Engineering and a B.S in Economics from the Wharton School. I have particular interests in entrepreneurship and creating high quality, maintainable software.

I'm currently an engineering intern at [Very Good Ventures](https://github.com/VGVentures) and also have been spending time developing version 3 of [UmpCast](https://github.com/UmpCast), a personal software project deployed to several local baseball little leagues. 

In my free time, I enjoy watching sports, spending time with friends/family, and learning more about poker.

Feel free to reach out for anything at jkao97@wharton.upenn.edu!
